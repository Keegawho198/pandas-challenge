# pandas-challenge - Keegan Nair - Week 4 Homework


From Looking at the results

The average passing rates for ALL SCHOOLS were 86% for Maths and %84% for Reading, However the overall passing rate was %72, 
which may indicate that many students may struggle with one subject but excel at the other.

On a closer look of the results, It was found that the highest passing overall grades was griffin high school, despite having one of the lowest budgets
of just $917,500. Griffin High school also had high reading and maths passing rates but again they had similar avarage score compared to other schools.

The schools with the lowest passing grades were Herandez, Huang and Johnson high schools, interestly these schools had some of the highest 
school budgets.

Overall, lower budget per students seem to perform better and have better overall passing results.
This may also be due to the size of a school, where smaller schools may perform better as they may be able to focus more on many students
and larger schools may struggle as there may be too many to focus on helping each student despite having a large budget.
